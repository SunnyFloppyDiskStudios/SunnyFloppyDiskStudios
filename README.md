👨‍💻 I'm a teen student with years of technical background and knowledge

My main projects relate with games and apps, so I mainly use Unity and Xcode.

I generally use C#, Swift, Lua, HTML/CSS, but I can also do C++, Python, Java, JS, or anything!

I also do graphic design, 3D modelling, and (sometimes) video editing!

### 🔨 Software of choice:
- Unity - Game Dev
- Xcode - App Dev
- Jetbrains - IDEs for literally anything
- Maya - 3D Modelling
- Sketch - Graphic Design & Illustration
- DaVinci Resolve - Video Editing
